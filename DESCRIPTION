Title: In-memory decompression for GNU zip and bzip2 formats.
Author: Duncan Temple Lang
Depends: methods, R (>= 1.0.0)
Maintainer: Duncan Temple Lang <duncan@wald.ucdavis.edu>
Description: The package is a basic interface to some of the compression 
   facilities in the zlib and bzip2 libraries for uncompressing (and compressing)
   data in memory that is not in a file. It handles bz2, gzip and regular compress (.Z)
   content.  It can work on files or with data in memory, e.g. downloaded directly into memory
   via an HTTP request.  It is used when we don't want to write 
   data to a file and then read it back into R. This is common when performing
   HTTP requests via the RCurl package and dependent packages such as SSOAP.
