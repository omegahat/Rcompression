This package was developed by Duncan Temple Lang (duncan@r-project.org)
but includes adapted code from several different distributions
by numerous authors.


crypt.h 
ioapi.c 
ioapi.h 
miniunz.c
miniunzip.h (renamed unzip.h)
minizip.h   (renamed zip.h)
unzip.c     (with modifications by DTL to change the parameter
             declarations to ANSI C from K&R style and some braces
             around if() bodies.)

are all from the contrib/minzip/ directory
of zlib-1.2.3 and  Copyright (C) 1998-2005 Gilles Vollant


untgz.c
untgz.h

 are derived from untgz.c from the contrib/untgz directory of 
 zlib-1.2.3.  I have create the .h file from the original untgz.c
 and then modified the code in untgz.c from the original so that
 we can use a subset of the routines and and have callbacks
 for "entry events".

 The original code has:
   written by Pedro A. Aranda Gutierrez <paag@tid.es>
   adaptation to Unix by Jean-loup Gailly <jloup@gzip.org>
   various fixes by Cosmin Truta <cosmint@cs.ubbcluj.ro>



bzip2.c
zlib.c
RConverters.c
RConverters.h
Runtgz.c
Runzip.c

  were created by DTL.
