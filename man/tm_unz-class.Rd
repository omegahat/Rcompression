\title{Representation of date and time information from a zip archive entry}
\description{
  Objects of this class provide a representation of date and time
  information
  about an entry in a zip archive file.
  The components are similar to those of the \code{POSIXlt}
  representation in R, but do not include as many fields.
  Objects can be converted \code{POSIXlt} using the
  \code{as.POSIXlt} method and from there to
  \code{POSIXct}.

  The class \code{tm_unzRef} is used to return an opaque reference to a
  C-level data structure rather than a copy of the contents of that
  structure which is what \code{tm_unz} represents.
}
\section{Objects from the Class}{
  Objects of this class are typically created in C code
  called by \code{\link{getZipInfo}} rather than directly within R.
